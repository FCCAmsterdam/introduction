# FreeCodeCamp - Amsterdam branch

### Welcome

This [Github](https://github.com) organisation - [FCCAmsterdam](https://github.com/FCCAmsterdam) - is for Amsterdam based developers who are following the [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) projects, and would like to gain some "real world" experience of developing software in teams, with volunteers who work in the industry.  Once you can build even a basic application, it's time dip your toes into other tasks.

Github is _almost_ the universal standard in software collaboration platforms, so learning how to work asynchronously is a vital skill before entering the professional world.

Learning how to build software in a team via Github also opens up the door for developers to "hit the ground running" if they would like to start contributing to Open Source Software.

### Why?

_The primary aim of this Github organisation is to provide a realistic collaborative environment for those who wish to go beyond building apps solo, and work as a team._

It also gives developers an opportunity to explore other areas of software development with experienced volunteers - Infrastructure-as-code;  build pipelines;  Networking;  server configuration management; etc.

### Who's who?
The _current_ author behind this page is _Ali Fay_ ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alifay) / [@completerevolution [Github]](https://github.com/completerevolution)), a seasoned systems engineer who's been breaking, fixing and optimising web application infrastructures for over a decade.  In July 2018, he is joining [@Dimebox](https://github.com/dimebox) (Amsterdam based fintech company) as a Senior Systems Engineer. Before Dimebox, he was the Lead DevOps Engineer [@VONQ](https://github.com/vonq)

As the FCCAmsterdam group gains some traction we welcome people to join!

### DevOps - you can't avoid it.
In recent years there has been a push (thanks to developments in technology) for Developers to undertake more operations work, which the marketing departments have coined "DevOps".   In previous years, Developers had to submit support requests to Operations for building infrastructures and deploying their code.

Thanks to APIs, tooling (built with automation in mind) and faster hardware, Developers now have the power not only to spin up "development environments" on their local laptops, but roll out their freshly tested code to production systems.

This Github organisation provides a framework for those wishing to learn such skills from existing IT operations professionals.

### The bigger picture

##### _"Writing code is only a small part of software engineering"_

Github provides a platform for new developers to understand the bigger picture of what happens to the code they write.

This is only a small list of 'other' processes involved:

1. Collaboration
  * [Peer code reviewing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review)
  * [Software architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design) discussions involving Operations
  * [Software version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) via [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * [Asynchronous written communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_learning)
  * Remote working via video link [Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com) and [Skype](https://www.skype.com)
  * Project Management
  * [Bug/Feature tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_tracking_system)
  * [Coding Standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions)

2. Testing
  * Testing methodologies and frameworks [(TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
  * [Automated Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation)
  * [Release Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_engineering)
  * [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (and merge conflict management)
  * [Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery))
  * [Continuous Deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery#Relationship_to_continuous_deployment)

3. Deployment
  * [Zero-downtime upgrades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability)
  * [Automated rollouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_release)
  * Automated rollbacks
  * Various deployment methods (blue/green; [canary release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle#Canary_release); [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model); [feature toggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle))

4. Monitoring
  * Performance monitoring of application code
  * Code refactoring based on performance feedback

5. Infrastructure
  * Software stacks - [LAMP; LEMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle); [MEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle);
  * Server architecture - [caching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)); [failover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failover); capacity planning
  * [Systems Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_management)
  * Containers - [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Kubernetes](https://www.kubernetes.io)
  * [Infrastructure-as-Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code) - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), [AWS Cloud Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)

6. Security
  * Automated security testing
  * Sources of information for Developers
